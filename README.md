# VOC-ALS
Script to extract acoustic features for VOC-ALS Database: VOiCe signals acquired in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Patients and Healthy Controls

Data processing related to VOC-ALS Database (https://doi.org/10.7303/syn53009474) has been performed in Matlab and Python. 
Here we share the Python script used to extract the multiple acoustic features. The script uses the Parselmouth[1], a Python library for the Praat software[2].
